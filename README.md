## Running the tests ⚙️

_In the Git System or in Visual Studio Code, you can put the application to run taking into account the IOS and Android emulators, taking into account that you have Mac or Windows, and you must also have the Flutter extensions, after that you just have to give it **Ctrl + shift + p** in Windows, **Command + p** or on Mac and run the emulator and then proceed to give it f5 to run and ready._
